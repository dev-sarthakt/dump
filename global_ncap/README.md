The primary objective of this program is to assess the overall safety rating of a car based on five critical performance parameters: Head Impact, Rear Impact, Warning and Brake Assist, Autonomous Emergency Braking, and Lane Keep Assist. These criteria are vital in determining both the vehicle's structural integrity and the effectiveness of its driver-assistance systems in preventing accidents or minimizing injuries. 

The user is prompted to enter a score (ranging from 1 to 5) for each parameter. A score of 5 represents excellent performance, while 1 denotes poor performance. After collecting the scores, the program calculates their average, which is used to determine the overall safety rating. 

This average score is then mapped to a star-based grading system, from 1 star (poor safety) to 5 stars (excellent safety), offering users a clear and intuitive understanding of the vehicle's safety level.
