In a traditional petrol pump setup, the fuel dispensing meters and the billing system often operate as two separate entities. The dispenser measures the quantity of fuel delivered, while the cashier or operator manually enters the data into the billing system. This manual process not only introduces the risk of human error and data mismatch but also creates opportunities for fraud and inaccuracy in stock management. To overcome these limitations, an integrated billing system directly linked with the fuel pump meter is developed. In this system, the meter readings are automatically captured and synchronized with the billing software in real time. Each transaction, from the moment fuel is dispensed to the generation of the customer bill, is handled digitally and securely, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and efficiency. Such integration also allows for automated record keeping, inventory control, and analytics, helping petrol pump owners maintain precise accounts and reduce operational losses.

The program begins by initializing the fuel rates for petrol and diesel, along with variables to store the selected product, fuel volume, payment mode, mobile number, and vehicle number. The user is first greeted with a welcome screen displaying the current fuel prices. Then, the customer selects either petrol or diesel as the product. Based on the selection, the system asks for the number of litres to be filled.
To simulate the fuel pumping process, a loop (for loop) runs from 0 to the entered volume, showing the live count of litres being dispensed along with the cumulative cost. The sleep(1) function is used to create a short one second delay between iterations, giving the effect of fuel being pumped in real time similar to what happens at an actual petrol dispenser display.
Once fueling is complete, the program asks for the payment mode (Cash, Card, or UPI), followed by the userâ€™s mobile number and vehicle number. After gathering this data, it prints a well formatted invoice on the screen, which includes all relevant transaction details.
